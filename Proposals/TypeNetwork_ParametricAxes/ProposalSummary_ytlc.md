## Proposed Axis Details

**Tag:** ytlc

**Name:** Y Transparent Lowercase

**Axis type:** Parametric

**Description:** assigns a “white” per mille value to each instance of the design space

**Valid numeric range:**  0 to 1000

**Scale interpretation:** Values should be interpreted as per-mille-of-em

**Recommended or required “Regular” value:** N/A

**Suggested programmatic interactions:** Example: Program or script may adjust the uppercase in coordination with another language or script, or adjust uppercase letters for a tv, vr, video setting to adjust to space, resolution or orientation.  

**UI recommendations:** Users may choose to program a variant in connection to direct or conjunctive input for a page description language, or via a user interface

**Script or language considerations:** Can be used for all scripts

**Related axes:**  wght, width, opsz

**Similar axes:** ytuc, ytde, ytas

**Additional information:** `ytlc` changes lowercase letters white space in the y direction. This axis contributes to opsz by raising the lowercase to increase legibility in small sizes. By allowing this axes to be used independently of opsz, the axis contributes to expanding the design space of a typeface. The "x height" of lowercase Latin letters is an attribute that many users can point to, but rather than calling this axes "x height," we see conventionality benefits in a name that fits into the systematic structure of this overall proposal: Y dimension transparency of lower case letters. ![Demonstration](demos/animation-ytlc.gif)
