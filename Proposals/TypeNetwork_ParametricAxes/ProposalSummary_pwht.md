**Axis type:** Optical

**Description:** Used to vary stroke thicknesses or other design details to give variation from lighter to blacker; may be constructed by blending other parametric axes, or via referenced instances of other axes

**Valid numeric range:**  1 to 2000

**Scale interpretation:** Values should be interpreted as per-mille-of-em

**Recommended or required “Regular” value:** N/A

**Suggested programmatic interactions:** Example: Program or script may easily compute the appropriate weight to get a specific stem thickness.

**UI recommendations:** Primarily through end-user interfaces

**Script or language considerations:** Can be used for all scripts

**Related axes:** Always: xtra xopq. Sometimes: yopq ytlc ytos ytus 

**Similar axes:** wght
