## Proposed Axis Details

**Tag:** ytuc

**Name:** Y Transparent Uppercase

**Axis type:** Parametric

**Description:** a “white” per mille value for each Uppercase Height in the design space

**Valid numeric range:**  -1000 to 1000

**Scale interpretation:** Values should be interpreted as per-mille-of-em

**Recommended or required “Regular” value:** N/A

**Suggested programmatic interactions:** Example: Program or script may adjust the uppercase in coordination with another language or script, or adjust uppercase letters in a tv, vr, video setting to adjust to space, resolution or orientation.  

**UI recommendations:** Users may choose to program a variant in connection to direct or conjunctive input for a page description language, or via a user interface

**Script or language considerations:** Can be used for all scripts

**Related axes:** wght, width, opsz

**Similar axes:** ytlc, ytde, ytas

**Additional information:** `ytuc` changes the y direction or white space in uppercase letters. By itself, contributes to the design space when building of small, medium and tall capitals, or unicase. The height of the upper case Latin letters is an attribute that all users can easily point to, but rather than calling this axes "cap height," we see conventionality benefits in a name that fits into the systematic structure of this overall proposal: Y dimension transparency of upper case letters. ![Demonstration](demos/animation-ytuc.gif)
